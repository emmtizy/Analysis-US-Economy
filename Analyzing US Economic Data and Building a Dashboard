Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard
Description
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some essential economic indicators from some data, you will then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. You can then share the dashboard via an URL.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this lab, you will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate. You will take screen shots of every step, you will share the notebook and the URL pointing to the dashboard.

In this section, we define the function make_dashboard. You don't have to know how the function works, you should only care about the inputs. The function will produce a dashboard as well as an html file. You can then use this html file to share your dashboard. If you do not know what an html file is don't worry everything you need to know will be provided in the lab.

In [2]:
def make_dashboard(x, gdp_change, unemployment, title, file_name):
    output_file(file_name)
    output_notebook()
    p = figure(title=title, x_axis_label='year', y_axis_label='%')
    p.line(x.squeeze(), gdp_change.squeeze(), color="firebrick", line_width=4, legend="% GDP change")
    p.line(x.squeeze(), unemployment.squeeze(), line_width=4, legend="% unemployed")
    show(p)
The dictionary links contain the CSV files with all the data. The value for the key GDP is the file that contains the GDP data. The value for the key unemployment contains the unemployment data.

In [4]:
links={'GDP':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_gdp.csv',\
       'unemployment':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_unemployment.csv'}
Question 1: Create a dataframe that contains the GDP data and display the first five rows of the dataframe.
Use the dictionary links and the function pd.read_csv to create a Pandas dataframes that contains the GDP data.

Hint: links["GDP"] contains the path or name of the file.

In [5]:
import pandas as pd
csv_path=links['GDP']
df=pd.read_csv(csv_path)
df.head()

63	2011	8.933333
Question 4: Use the function make_dashboard to make a dashboard
In this section, you will call the function make_dashboard , to produce a dashboard. We will use the convention of giving each variable the same name as the function parameter.

Create a new dataframe with the column 'date' called x from the dataframe that contains the GDP data.

In [11]:
import pandas as pd
links={'GDP':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_gdp.csv',\
       'unemployment':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_unemployment.csv'}
csv_path=links['GDP']
gdp_dataframe=pd.read_csv(csv_path)
x = pd.DataFrame(gdp_dataframe, columns=['date'])
x.head()
Out[11]:
date
0	1948
1	1949
2	1950
3	1951
4	1952
Create a new dataframe with the column 'change-current'  called gdp_change from the dataframe that contains the GDP data.

In [12]:
import pandas as pd
links={'GDP':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_gdp.csv',\
       'unemployment':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_unemployment.csv'}
csv_path=links['GDP']
gdp_dataframe=pd.read_csv(csv_path)
gdp_change = pd.DataFrame(gdp_dataframe, columns=['change-current'])
gdp_change.head()
Out[12]:
change-current
0	-0.7
1	10.0
2	15.7
3	5.9

Create a new dataframe with the column 'unemployment'  called unemployment from the dataframe that contains the unemployment data.

In [13]:
import pandas as pd
links={'GDP':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_gdp.csv',\
       'unemployment':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_unemployment.csv'}

unemployment
0	3.750000
1	6.050000
2	5.208333
3	3.283333
4	3.025000
Give your dashboard a string title, and assign it to the variable title

In [14]:
title = "Unemployement stats according to GDP"
Finally, the function make_dashboard will output an .html in your direictory, just like a csv file. The name of the file is "index.html" and it will be stored in the varable file_name.

In [15]:
file_name = "index.html"
Call the function make_dashboard , to produce a dashboard. Assign the parameter values accordingly take a the , take a screen shot of the dashboard and submit it.

In [16]:
make_dashboard(x=x, gdp_change=gdp_change, unemployment=unemployment, title=title, file_name=file_name)

Question 5: Save the dashboard on IBM cloud and display it
From the tutorial PROVISIONING AN OBJECT STORAGE INSTANCE ON IBM CLOUD copy the JSON object containing the credentials you created. You’ll want to store everything you see in a credentials variable like the one below (obviously, replace the placeholder values with your own). Take special note of your access_key_id and secret_access_key. Do not delete # @hidden_cell  as this will not allow people to see your credentials when you share your notebook.


credentials = {

   "apikey": "your-api-key",

   "cos_hmac_keys": {

    "access_key_id": "your-access-key-here", 

     "secret_access_key": "your-secret-access-key-here"

   },


    "endpoints": "your-endpoints",

   "iam_apikey_description": "your-iam_apikey_description",

   "iam_apikey_name": "your-iam_apikey_name",

   "iam_role_crn": "your-iam_apikey_name",

    "iam_serviceid_crn": "your-iam_serviceid_crn",

  "resource_instance_id": "your-resource_instance_id"

}

In [22]:
credentials={
  "apikey": "-n5US7Ck5Pe9JhdBsx_4rrVW4QMsWa0NYeCK4DOPzta_",
  "cos_hmac_keys": {
    "access_key_id": "2016460a0bed4e08aa9afcd94447448e",
    "secret_access_key": "89b74ef09e60fd688171729fa300a2961139095650bb3587"
  },
  "endpoints": "https://control.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com/v2/endpoints",
  "iam_apikey_description": "Auto-generated for key 2016460a-0bed-4e08-aa9a-fcd94447448e",
  "iam_apikey_name": "WDP-Editor-pythonfordatascienceproject-donotdelete-pr-tqo1rx2vjxhzwn",
  "iam_role_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Writer",
  "iam_serviceid_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/14d5bc96c3b84588b60433b993eaeb26::serviceid:ServiceId-0ff194bb-40ef-41b9-b3bb-b506dfbf11a2",
  "resource_instance_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/14d5bc96c3b84588b60433b993eaeb26:225ec5f9-14a9-4473-a2b1-2b855b58ce3f::"
}
You will need the endpoint make sure the setting are the same as PROVISIONING AN OBJECT STORAGE INSTANCE ON IBM CLOUD assign the name of your bucket to the variable bucket_name 

In [23]:
endpoint = 'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net'
From the tutorial PROVISIONING AN OBJECT STORAGE INSTANCE ON IBM CLOUD assign the name of your bucket to the variable bucket_name 

In [24]:
bucket_name ="pythonfordatascienceproject-donotdelete-pr-tqo1rx2vjxhzwn"
We can access IBM Cloud Object Storage with Python useing the boto3 library, which we’ll import below:

In [25]:
import boto3
We can interact with IBM Cloud Object Storage through a boto3 resource object.

In [26]:
resource = boto3.resource(
    's3',
    aws_access_key_id = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]['access_key_id'],
    aws_secret_access_key = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]["secret_access_key"],
    endpoint_url = endpoint,
)
We are going to use open to create a file object. To get the path of the file, you are going to concatenate the name of the file stored in the variable file_name. The directory stored in the variable directory using the + operator and assign it to the variable html_path. We will use the function getcwd() to find current the working directory.

In [27]:
import os
directory = os.getcwd()
html_path=directory +"/"+file_name
directory
Out[27]:
'/home/dsxuser/work'
Now you must read the html file, use the function f = open(html_path, mode) to create a file object and assign it to the variable f. The parameter file should be the variable html_path, the mode should be "r" for read.

In [28]:
directory = os.getcwd()
f = open(html_path, "r")
To load your dataset into the bucket we will use the method put_object, you must set the parameter name to the name of the bucket, the parameter Key should be the name of the HTML file and the value for the parameter Body should be set to f.read().

In [29]:
# Fill up the parameters in the following function:
resource.Bucket(name=bucket_name).put_object(Key=file_name, Body=f.read())
Out[29]:
s3.Object(bucket_name='pythonfordatascienceproject-donotdelete-pr-tqo1rx2vjxhzwn', key='index.html')
In the dictionary Params provide the bucket name as the value for the key 'Bucket'. Also for the value of the key 'Key' add the name of the html file, both values should be strings.

In [30]:
Params = {'Bucket': bucket_name,'Key': file_name }
The following lines of code will generate a URL to share your dashboard. The URL only last seven days, but don't worry you will get full marks if the URL is visible in your notebook.

In [31]:
import sys
time = 7*24*60**2
client = boto3.client(
    's3',
    aws_access_key_id = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]['access_key_id'],
    aws_secret_access_key = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]["secret_access_key"],
    endpoint_url=endpoint,

)
url = client.generate_presigned_url('get_object',Params=Params,ExpiresIn=time)
print(url)
https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/pythonfordatascienceproject-donotdelete-pr-tqo1rx2vjxhzwn/index.html?Expires=1557257416&AWSAccessKeyId=2016460a0bed4e08aa9afcd94447448e&Signature=Q8Jf3pE9AVLIYe1yBDsaFfyvSBs%3D
